        <h2>Dartmouth '24</h2>
        <p>Super excited to be here! I'm from Beverly MA, a town the northern coast of MA. I'm interested 
            in studying CS and statistics at Dartmouth and learning Mandarin Chinese. I've programmed 
            before in Java and Python for robotics applications, but I've never done much web development
            before. Outside of class I enjoy running and baking. I have no pets :( but I am a cat person.
